# Intro to JS, Session 4 p5.js

* p5.js is a javascript library for creating interactive animations
* We are going to use p5.js to create a game, but first we are just going to play around and learn how it works.

## Links

* [p5js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) this is where you can create things with p5js, if you log in (with your github account) then you can save your creations
* [p5.js getting started](https://p5js.org/get-started/) scroll down to the 'Your First Sketch' section and work from there
* [p5.js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) to find out how to use things
* [p5.js examples](https://p5js.org/examples/)
* [p5.js codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/z21o8n1qjx) a more advanced web editor, you can log in with github to save your work

## Task

We are going to use p5 to create something (anything!), have a play around with it, and see what you come up with. [There are lots of examples here](https://p5js.org/examples/) have a look at the code to see how they work.

It could be a game, an animation, a toy..... 

[One of my favourites is this one](https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-wavemaker.html)

You could create something from scratch, or take one of the examples and mix it up.

You can search on google or youtube for p5js and you will find lots of tutorials and guides, and exmaples of things people have made.

[Youtube channel The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) has lots of good videos about creating things with javascript and p5.js. His [programming in javascript with p5.js playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) is a great place to start.

There will be a Â£10 prize for the best creation at the next session, you will have to explain to us all how you created it.
