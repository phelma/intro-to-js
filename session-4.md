# Intro to JS, Session 4 p5js

* p5.js is a javascript library for creating interactive animations
* We are going to use p5.js to create a game, but first we are just going to play around

## Links

* [p5js web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) this is where you can create things with p5js, if you log in (with your github account) then you can save your creations
* [p5js getting started](https://p5js.org/get-started/) scroll down to the 'Your First Sketch' section and work from there
* [p5js reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) to find out how to use things
* [p5js examples](https://p5js.org/examples/)

## Task

We are going to use p5 to create something, have a play around with it, and see what you come up with. [There are lots of examples here](https://p5js.org/examples/).

[One of my favourites is this one](https://p5js.org/examples/interaction-wavemaker.html)

You could create something from scratch, or take one of the examples and mix it up.

You can search on google or youtube for p5js and you will find lots of tutorials and guides, and exmaples of things people have made

There will be a Â£10 prize for the best one by the end of next week's session, you will have to explain to me how you created it.
